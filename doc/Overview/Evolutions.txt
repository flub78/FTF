Title: FTF Evolutions
#####################

    Perl language has evolved since the latest
    version of FTF and new modules have been developed
    which take in several of the modules of FTF.
    
    I also need to rework on the event loop associated 
    with TCP/IP networking to adpat it to heavy network
    load.
    
    So the future evolutions should be.
    
    1) Replacement of the event loop by POE. Two approaches are possible, to
    keep the current interface and to built it above POE, or
    to change the application themselves to use POE directly.
    
    The two layers are almost at the same level of abstraction, so
    build one on top of the other cannot be justified only for technical
    reasons. And the quantity of code which relies on FTF::Events is not so big.
    
    So the best approach is probably to develop a set of small programs,
    illustrating most of the Event features, and then to use them to post
    the existing tests with the new paradigm.
    
    I need:
        - Binary and ASCII tcp/ip servers and clients
        - Binary and ASCII udp/ip networking
        - File Management
        - Time management and sockets timeout
    
    2) Replacement of the Object model by Moose.
